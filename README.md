# Inflasi-Indonesia_Algoritma-KMedoids

Inflation is one of the key economic indicators that directly affects a country's financial stability. In Indonesia, inflation has a wide-reaching impact, particularly on household purchasing power and economic growth. This study aims to classify 90 cities in Indonesia based on their inflation rates from 2019 to 2023 using the K-Medoids algorithm as a clustering technique. The algorithm was chosen for its ability to handle outliers and minimize the differences between data points within clusters. The analysis was conducted using Euclidean, Manhattan, and Minkowski distance metrics, with clustering quality evaluated using the Davies Bouldin Index (DBI) and Silhouette Coefficient (SC). The secondary data used was obtained from Indonesiaâ€™s Central Statistics Agency, focusing on the inflation rates of cities nationwide. The main findings show that Minkowski distance is the most effective metric, resulting in a DBI value of 0.851273 and an SC value of 0.473327 for 2022, which is identified as the year with the most optimal clustering results. The primary contribution of this study lies in the application of the K-Medoids algorithm, which is robust against outliers, as well as the use of multiple distance metrics to enhance the accuracy of inflation data analysis. These findings offer deeper insights into the variation in inflation rates among cities in Indonesia and can serve as a reference for formulating more effective economic policies to control inflation.
